## Who am I?

> My name is Guillermo, originally from Monterrey, Mexico. I moved to the US back in 2008, and it has been quite a ride. I graduated with a Finance degree from UTSA in 2014, and now I am enrolled in the MSDA program, also at UTSA. After the last crazy semester, I am counting down the days until graduation (Spring 2025) to be done with my school life forever. When I am not at work or school, I enjoy mountain biking, running, and going to music events.

## Professional Background

> I've recently taken on the role of Financial Analyst with HEB's Organizational Design team within the Corporate HR department. Prior to joining HEB, I gained valuable experience in various positions:
>
> -   At iHeartMedia, I served as a People Analyst, where I provided valuable insights and recommendations to help leadership gauge the health of the workforce.
>
> -   At RBFCU, I worked as a Business Risk Analyst in the Consumer Lending department, refining my skills in risk assessment and analysis.
>
> -   My career began at Rackspace, where I worked as a People Analytics Specialist. It was here that I discovered my passion for the field and laid the foundation for my career trajectory.
>
> Throughout my experience in this program, I have developed proficiency in various programming languages and tools, such as Python, SQL, SAS Enterprise Guide, R, and Tableau. My goal for this course is to strengthen my R skills to improve my analytical capabilities and apply these tools and techniques effectively in my current role.
